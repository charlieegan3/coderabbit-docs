The skill of conducting effective code reviews is an important skill for developers. Code reviews ensure high-quality code, facilitate knowledge sharing, and foster a collaborative team environment. Despite its importance, many tech leads and developers find themselves either spending an excessive amount of time on code reviews or struggling to provide constructive feedback to pull request (PR) authors.

Conversely, some colleagues seem to navigate code reviews with ease, showcasing that code review is indeed a skill that can be honed and improved.

But the question remains: How does one improve their code review skills? Is it beneficial to seek feedback from a coworker, compare your code review techniques with those of your peers, or is there an alternative strategy to enhance this critical skill?

Given the specificity of PRs to individual projects, generic feedback often falls short of being genuinely helpful. While coworkers can offer valuable insights, their availability to provide immediate feedback—when the context of the PR code changes is still fresh in your mind—can be limited.

The solution is “Self-Assessment”. Assess your Code Review skills and then improve your weaknesses.


## How to Assess Code Review Skills and Improve

Embarking on a journey to refine your code review skills, self-assessment emerges as the most effective strategy. This approach not only fosters a deeper understanding of code review practices but also encourages a mindset of continuous improvement. Here's a detailed plan to self-assess and enhance your code review capabilities:


### 1. Set a Time Limit for Reviewing New PRs

Begin by allocating a specific time frame, such as 15 minutes, to review new PRs. This constraint encourages efficiency and helps you focus on identifying the most critical aspects of the code without getting bogged down in minutiae.


### 2. Utilize Automated AI Tools

After completing your review, employ automated AI-based code review tools such as [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai/). These tools can quickly analyze code for common issues, style inconsistencies, and potential bugs, providing an immediate second opinion on the PR.


### 3. Compare and Reflect

Evaluate the feedback from the AI tools against your own review. Did you overlook anything obvious? Did you suggest any unnecessary optimizations? Reflecting on these comparisons helps you understand your review tendencies and biases, enabling you to adjust your approach accordingly.


### 4. Repeat and Learn

Make this self-assessment process a regular practice for new PRs. Each iteration offers new learning opportunities, gradually enhancing your ability to conduct thorough and effective code reviews.


### 5. Seek Feedback from Coworkers

In addition to self-assessment, actively seek out code reviews from your coworkers on your own contributions. This practice not only improves your code but also provides insight into different review styles and perspectives, enriching your understanding of effective code review practices.


## Why Self-Assessment Works

Self-assessment in code review serves multiple purposes. It not only accelerates your learning curve by providing immediate feedback but also cultivates a culture of self-improvement and accountability. By comparing your reviews with automated feedback and reflecting on the differences, you gain insights into your review process that would be difficult to achieve through external feedback alone.


## The Benefits of Mastering Code Review

Mastering the art of code review carries numerous benefits for both individual developers and their teams:


* Enhanced Code Quality: Effective code reviews catch issues early, reducing bugs and improving the overall quality of the codebase.
* Knowledge Sharing: Code reviews serve as a platform for sharing knowledge and best practices, helping team members learn from each other and grow their skills.
* Faster Development Cycles: By identifying and addressing issues early in the development process, teams can reduce the time spent on debugging and rework, leading to faster development cycles.
* Improved Team Collaboration: Regular and constructive code reviews build trust among team members, foster a culture of open communication, and encourage collaborative problem-solving.


## Conclusion

Improving your code review skills is a journey that requires patience, practice, and a proactive approach to learning. By embracing self-assessment, utilizing tools at your disposal, and engaging with your team, you can transform code review from a daunting task into an opportunity for growth and collaboration. Remember, the goal of code review is not just to find faults but to collectively ensure the development of high-quality, maintainable, and efficient code. As you refine your code review skills, you'll find yourself not only becoming a more effective reviewer but also contributing to the success and resilience of your development team.
